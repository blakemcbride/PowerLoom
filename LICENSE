License

Since 2005, PowerLoom® is available free-of-charge under a triple
disjunctive open-source licensing scheme that allows you to pick the
Mozilla Public License v. 1.1 (MPL), the GNU General Public License
v. 2.0 (GPL) or the the GNU Lesser Public License v. 2.1 (LGPL) to fit
your needs. This scheme is similar to what's used for the Mozilla web
browser and should give people maximum flexibility to use PowerLoom
even for commercial development while still retaining the advantages
of open-source licensing.
